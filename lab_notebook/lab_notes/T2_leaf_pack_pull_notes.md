Tanks sampled by KF and JH

### 13 June 2016 Sample the first set of leaf packs (T2)

Beginning at tank 1 and moving systematically to tank 30, we haphazardly selected a leaf pack in the tank for removal.

A 250 um mesh sieve was lowered into the tank near the leaf pack and then the pack was gently lifted onto the sieve.

Once out of the water the leaf pack was gently examined for macroinvertebrates and crayfish and then placed into a pre-weighed paper bag. 

### 6 June 2016 Tank observations 

No macroinvertebrates were seen in the packs

Some crayfish were sheltering under the leaf packs

Most leaf packs showed evidence of crayfish feeding along the margins as indicated by shredded margins

Some of the leaf packs appear to have moved from where they were placed. This may be due to crayfish, since there shouldn't be any physical forces sufficient to move the packs in the tanks.

Some of the tanks, especially near the woods had some other leaves fallen into them. We removed the leaves that were easily removed but not other items such as insects.

A few of the tanks had visible crayfish parts, which may have been exuvia

Many of the tanks had tadpoles swimming in them. The tadpoles were swimming mainly in the water and off the bottom, which may indicate that they were afraid of the crayfish

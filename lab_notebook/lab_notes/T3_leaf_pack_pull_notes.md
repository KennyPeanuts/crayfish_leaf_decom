### 27 June 2016 Sample the final set of leaf packs (T3)

Beginning at tank 1 and moving systematically to tank 30, we haphazardly selected a leaf pack in the tank for removal.

A 250 um mesh sieve was lowered into the tank near the leaf pack and then the pack was gently lifted onto the sieve.

Once out of the water the leaf pack was gently examined for macroinvertebrates and crayfish and then placed into a pre-weighed paper bag. 

### 27 June 2016 Tank observations 

No macroinvertebrates were seen in the packs

Many of the leaf packs were reduced to just the leaf ribs and what was clamped by the binder clip.

All the leaf macks had beem moved around by the crayfish and some were pulled inside the PVC shelters

Many of the tanks had tadpoles swimming in them. The tadpoles were swimming mainly in the water and off the bottom, which may indicate that they were afraid of the crayfish

All of the tanks had food pellets added for the crayfish. The pellets were floating so only the tadpoles were feeding on them.

We could not visually find the leaf packs in tanks 19, 27, and 24. In these tanks we had to run our hands along the bottom until we could feel the pack.

We also felt around in tank 25 even though we had already removed the pack because, we're human :)

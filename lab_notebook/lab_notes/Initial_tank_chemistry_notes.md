## 2 June 2016 YSI sampling

Beginning at tank 1 and working to tank 30, the YSI was inserted into the tank and allowed to equilibrate before recording the temperature, conductivity, percent DO, and DO concentration.

## 3 June 2016 Water collection

Beginning at tank 1 an working to tank 30, water was collected from each tank by submerging a 500 ml wide mouth Nalgine bottle upside down until it was at mid depth and then righting to fill with water.

The bottle was rinsed 3X with tank water before the sample was collected.

The bottles were transported back to the lab in a dark backpack

## 3 June 2016 Lab Water Processing

All of the water processing was completed with the lab lights off

pH: read unfiltered water with pH meter

DOC: filtered 30 ml of water through GFF and added 500 ul 2N HCl

Nutrients: filtered 30 ml of water through GFF and freezed 

Chl: clogged GFF with sample water ad freezed

### 6 June 2016 Sample the first set of leaf packs (T1)

Beginning at tank 1 and moving systematically to tank 30, we haphazardly selected a leaf pack in the tank for removal.

A 250 um mesh sieve was lowered into the tank near the leaf pack and then the pack was gently lifted onto the sieve.

Once out of the water the leaf pack was gently examined for macroinvertebrates and crayfish and then placed into a pre-weighed paper bag. 

The bags were housed in the EEC until transport back to the lab at the end of sampling where they were dried at 50 dC for 48 h

### 6 June 2016 Tank observations 

No macroinvertebrates were seen in the packs

Some crayfish were sheltering under the leaf packs

Most leaf packs showed evidence of crayfish feeding along the margins as indicated by shredded margins

Some of the leaf packs appear to have moved from where they were placed. This may be due to crayfish, since there shouldn't be any physical forces sufficient to move the packs in the tanks.

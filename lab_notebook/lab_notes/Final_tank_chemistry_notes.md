## 30 June 2016 YSI sampling

Beginning at tank 1 and working to tank 30, the YSI was inserted into the tank and allowed to equilibrate before recording the temperature, conductivity, percent DO, and DO concentration.

Beginning at tank 1 and working to tank 30, the light meter was lowered to the bottom of each tank in exactly the same location on the tank. Care was taken that cloud cover was constant during the measurements.

## 30 June 2016 Water collection

Beginning at tank 1 an working to tank 30, water was collected from each tank by submerging a 500 ml wide mouth Nalgine bottle upside down until it was at mid depth and then righting to fill with water.

The bottle was rinsed 3X with tank water before the sample was collected.

The bottles were transported back to the lab in a dark backpack

## 30 June 2016 Lab Water Processing

All of the water processing was completed with the lab lights off

pH: read unfiltered water with pH meter

DOC: filtered 30 ml of water through GFF into a pre-ashed glass vial and added 300 ul 2N HCl

Nutrients: filtered 30 ml of water through GFF into a 50 ml falcon tube and then frozen.

Chl: clogged GFF with sample water and then placed into a 15 ml falcon tube wrapped in foil, added 10 ml of 90% acetone and placed in the freezer. After approximately 12 h the filters were "mashed".

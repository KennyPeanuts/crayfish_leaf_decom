### Description

These data were collected by weighting the dry mass and ash free dry mass for each leaf pack in grams as part of an experiment assessing the impact of native and invasive crayfish on leaf litter.

## Variable Description 

* Date = the date that the leaf packs were collected (yyyy-mm-dd)

* BagTank = the the number of the tank from which the sample was taken

* CrucNum = the number that was previously labeled on the crucible 
  *NOTE: these numbers are in no particular order

* CrucLeafDM = the weight of the crucible and leaf dry mass  (g) 

* CrucAM = the weight of the crucible and ash mass (g)

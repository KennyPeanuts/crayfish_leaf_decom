### Description

These data were collected with a YSI EXO sonde with an optical DO meter as part of an experiment assessing the impact of native and invasive crayfish on leaf litter decomposition.

## Variable Descriptions

* data = the date that the measurements were made (yyyy-mm-dd)

* sampling = the id of the sampling time 
  * initial = the sampling at the approximate beginning of the experiment
  * mid = the sampling at the approximate mid-point of the experiment
  * final = the sampling at the approximate end of the experiment

* tank = the number of the tank from which the sample was taken

* temp = the water temperature (dC)

* cond = the conductivity of the water (uS / cm^2)
  * NOTE: the calibration of the conductivity on 2016-06-02 may be bad. The sensor reported out of range value when calibrating.

* percDO = the percent dissolved oxygen saturation

* concDO = the dissolved oxygen concentration (mg/L)

* pH = pH of the water sample

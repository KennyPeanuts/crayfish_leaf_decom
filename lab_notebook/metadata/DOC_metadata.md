### Description

These data were collected by taking a 500 ml water sample from each tank. 30 ml of water was filtered through a 25 mm GFF filter and acidified with 600 ul of 2N HCl.  Filtrate collected on June 3 and Aug 5 were collected into 50 ml plastic conical bottom tubes before being transferred to the glass DOC tubes. The samples collected on June 16 and August 5 were filtered directly into the glass DOC tubes. The DOC was run on the DOC METER at Longwood
